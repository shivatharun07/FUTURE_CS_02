# 🚨 Task 2 - Social Engineering & Phishing Simulation

This project is part of the FutureInterns Cybersecurity Internship.  
I used the **Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)** to simulate a phishing attack by cloning a test login page and capturing credentials.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- SET (Social Engineering Toolkit)
- testphp.vulnweb.com (cloned site)

---

## 🧪 What I Did
- Cloned a login page using SET's Credential Harvester
- Hosted it locally at `http://172.16.144.214`
- Simulated a victim entering credentials
- Captured the credentials in the terminal

---

## ✅ Outcome
- Successfully demonstrated how phishing pages work
- Credentials were harvested and displayed in the terminal

---

## 🔐 Recommendation
- Train users to check URLs before logging in
- Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA)
